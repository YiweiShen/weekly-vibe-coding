## Prompt (Zero-Shot)

Create a modern, minimalist landing page for a Mac-exclusive email app. The design should be clean, elegant, and focused on simplicity and productivity. Highlight key features such as distraction-free inbox, smart filtering, fast search, and seamless macOS integration. Include a hero section with a mockup of the app on a MacBook, concise feature highlights, user testimonials, and a clear call-to-action (e.g., "Download for macOS"). Use a neutral color palette (e.g., white, soft gray, accent blue), ample whitespace, and smooth typography (like San Francisco or Inter). The tone should reflect calm efficiency and premium design.
