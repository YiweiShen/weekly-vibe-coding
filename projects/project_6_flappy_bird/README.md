## Prompt

Create a modern-looking Flappy Bird clone as a single HTML page. The game should be fully playable in the browser, without external dependencies except for standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus on clean, modern visualsâ€”avoid pixel art. Utilize smooth colors, gradients, and simple geometric shapes for a fresh look. The game should include:

- A responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile screens.
- A start screen, game screen, and a game-over screen.
- Animations for the bird and pipes.
- Keyboard (spacebar), mouse, and touch controls to make the bird "flap".
- A display of the current and best scores.
- Restart functionality after the game ends.
- Well-commented and organized code.
